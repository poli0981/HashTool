# Security Policy for HashTool

**Version 1.1.3**  
**Last updated: February 2026**

HashTool is a free, open-source desktop application built with C# (.NET 10) and Avalonia UI. It runs **100% offline** (except optional update check via GitHub), processes files locally, and has no network server components.

### Supported Versions
Currently, security updates are provided for the latest release only:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

### Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not open a public issue** — this prevents malicious exploitation.
2. Use one of the following methods:
    - Open a **private vulnerability report** via GitHub's Security tab (preferred).
    - Or create a draft security advisory: [here](https://github.com/poli0981/HashTool/security/advisories/new)
    - If you can't use GitHub, email: [here](mailto:lopop05905@pm.me) (or just open a regular issue and mark it 
      private if possible).

Please include:
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact

### What to Expect
- I will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours (if possible).
- I'll investigate and respond with next steps (accept/decline, timeline for fix).
- If accepted, a fix will be released as soon as practical, and you'll be credited in the release notes (unless you prefer anonymity).
- If declined, I'll explain why.

Thank you for helping keep HashTool secure! 🛡️
