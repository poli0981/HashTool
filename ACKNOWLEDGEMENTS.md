# Acknowledgements

HashTool would not have been possible without the generous contributions of open-source projects, third-party libraries, and AI assistance during development.

All AI-generated content (code suggestions, translations, text) was carefully reviewed, tested, and verified by the author.

### AI Assistance
- **Gemini 3 Pro** (including Jules Agent) (by Google): Provided code suggestions, debugging help, error detection,
  and fixes.
- **Grok 4.1** (by xAI): Code suggestions, multi-language translations (30+ languages), and assistance in writing documentation/texts (e.g., Disclaimer, Privacy Policy).

Big thanks to these AIs for speeding up development.
