# Contributing to HashTool

Thanks for taking an interest in HashTool. Your contributions help make it better for everyone.
Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a new feature, or submitting code, every contribution is appreciated.

This project is still small and solo-maintained, so keep it simple and direct — I read everything.

## Reporting Bugs or Requesting Features

**Super easy way**:
- Check the **pinned issues** first (there'll be a "Bug Reports" and "Feature Requests" thread).
- Just **comment** on the relevant thread, or create a new issue if it doesn't fit.

### Issue Template (keep it short!)
Please use this format in your issue title and body:

**Title**  
`Bug: <short description>` or `Feature: <short description>`  
(e.g., `Bug: App crashes on large files` or `Feature: Add CRC32 algorithm`)

**Body**
1. **Description**  
   Clearly explain the bug or the feature you'd like.  
   Example for bug: "NullReferenceException when selecting >100 files on Windows 11".

2. **Steps to Reproduce** (for bugs) or **Expected Behavior** (for features)  
   Be specific if possible.

3. **Screenshots** (optional but super helpful)  
   Drag & drop images directly into the issue.

4. **Pseudo-code / Suggestion** (optional)  
   If you have an idea how to fix/implement it, share it!

5. **Priority** (optional)  
   Your opinion: "Critical", "Nice to have", "Low priority", etc.

That's it! No strict rules — just be clear and concise.

## Submitting Code (Pull Requests)

Want to fix something yourself? Awesome.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/crash-on-large-files` or `feature/new-algorithm`.
4. Make your changes (follow existing code style — clean, readable C#).
5. Test thoroughly (especially on both Windows & macOS if possible).
6. Push and open a Pull Request.
    - Link the related issue in the PR description.
    - Keep PRs focused on one thing when possible.

I'll review as fast as I can. If it's good, it gets merged and you get credit.

## Code Style & Guidelines
- Keep it simple and consistent with existing code.
- Add comments for tricky parts.
- No strict linter yet — just make it readable.

## Code of Conduct
Please be respectful — see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

Thanks again for helping make HashTool better.
